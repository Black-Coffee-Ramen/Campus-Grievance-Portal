# Campus Grievance Portal

This project is a **low-fidelity prototype** of a Campus Grievance Redressal Portal.  
It was created as part of a usability study for exploring how students, faculty, and staff might report and track grievances on campus.  

**Live Prototype:** [Campus-Grievance-Portal](https://black-coffee-ramen.github.io/Campus-Grievance-Portal/)  
**Updated Prototype:** [A lil more than lo-fi](https://athiyo.github.io/Campus-Grievance-Portal/)

## Note
- This is **only a low-fidelity prototype**.  
- Some features (like AI support, automated responses, or real database connections) are **not functional** â€” they are included only as placeholders for testing the design.  
- Please focus on the layout, navigation, and overall usability, not the technical backend.

## Features (Prototype)
- **Submit a grievance** through a simple form (categories: academic, infrastructure, harassment, administration, etc.).  
- **Track grievance status** using a reference ID.  
- **Escalate an issue** if it has not been resolved in time.  
- Basic navigation structure to simulate the full portal flow.
